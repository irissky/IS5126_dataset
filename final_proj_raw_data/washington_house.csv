            ",Apartment,"desc::This fabulous 1-bed/1-bath residence checks all the boxes: sunny, private outdoor space; assigned garage parking; abundant storage; beautiful finishes; and an amenity-rich building in an unbeatable location.  Conveniently located on the mezzanine level for an easy in and out--perfect for pet owners!--unit M08 welcomes you with a charming entrance complete with coat closet and stacked washer/dryer.  To your left, a cheerful kitchen, offering warm wood cabinetry, breakfast bar, roomy pantry and granite countertops. The open, well-lit living space has more than enough room for a guest-worthy dining area. And the gallery-style lighting lets you highlight your art collection or light up the freshly-painted walls. Through the sliding glass doors and out on the patio, you'll enjoy lush courtyard views--a perfect spot for sipping morning coffee or evening wine or working the day away. The bedroom is large enough for a king-sized bed and cozy with soft-under-foot carpet.  Adjacent to the bedroom, you have a very large bathroom with tub/shower and a large vanity with a single sink (but large enough for two, if you prefer). Keeping up the theme of ""large"", the closet is just that with great built-in storage.  Complete the experience with assigned garage parking (space G2-24), self-contained HVAC (not a convector or shared system), staffed front desk, a fitness center to shame all others, a comfortable club room that can be reserved for private or work-related events, two common outdoor patio areas and a Walk Score of 97 and a Bike Score of 95, and the only question you'll be asking yourself is why you haven't started packing already! Just steps to all the conveniences of Logan Circle, including Whole Foods, Vida Fitness, Le Diplomate and all your other favorite restaurants and neighborhood hot spots, this is a fantastic home not to be missed!||","Property Type::

NoMa is within a short walk to shops, cafés, and restaurants that possess a local and authentic feeling notwithstanding their relatively recent emergence into the cityscape.  Many new buildings, and those currently under construction, share their presence with fine and handsome 19th century brick rowhouses that rival any in Washington. The building is a perfect fit for the neighborhood, expressed in the same architectural idiom as some of its early 20th century predecessors.  A large, luminous, and gracious lobby offers a staffed 24-hour front desk, and all shared spaces in the building have been designed using the best quality materials in an attractive, contemporary style.  Among the building’s other amenities are a party room for private events, a gym, a business center, and a second-floor swimming pool. This fifth floor one-bedroom, one-bathroom unit has its own outdoor space, with a view of two-story rowhouses, making it quiet and private.  A superb floor plan and its location in the building make it especially desirable. Includes storage unit. Parking available onsite.||","Property Type::

All this and no condo or HOA fees!  A floor plan is included in the photos.  More information on this home and the surrounding neighborhood can be found on the Duvall Moderns website.

This high-end property, constructed in 2018, includes a mix of one studio/1-bath unit; five 1-bed/1-bath units; and two 1-bed/1.5-bath units, all with stunning finishes, including Italian Fenix cabinetry in the kitchens and baths, wide plank French oak flooring, marble baths and backsplashes, and large floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding interior doors for tons of natural light. Seven of the units include private outdoor spaces, some quite large. All units include washers/dryers and separately metered electricity, HVAC and hot water. Fully-occupied with a NOI of nearly $180,000 annually, this is a fantastic stable long-term rental property--so attractive that tenants have requested multi-year leases and escalated over the advertised rent in the past to secure a unit. Continue to operate this as a long-term rental, or, as units turn over, consider short-term/corporate rentals for a potentially higher return. As this property has already been converted to a condominium (and this sale includes all units in the building), you also have the option of selling the units off individually over time. (The current sale includes all units; units will not be sold individually.) The location of this Columbia Heights gem can't be beat, with the green/yellow metro stop less than a 10-minute walk and Meridian Hill Park, several grocery stores and all the popular shops, bars and restaurants of 14th Street just steps away. Walk Score: 93; Bike Score: 91. Floor plans, photos and virtual tour of all 8 units are available in the attachments.  Because this is a 100% occupied building, out of consideration for tenants and due to COVID-19 precautions, no in-person showings will be available prior to submission of an LOI.||","Property Type::

Sewer is approx. 14' deep and in front of the house = deep basement dig-out resulting in front facade largely above above-grade because of the existing 3' crawl space and front yard slope.

The 11’ x 8’ breakfast room adjacent to the Kitchen is surrounded by north, east and south elevation insulated windows overlooking the spectacular East Garden and patio entertainment area.

The 2nd level has 3 generously sized bedrooms including a primary bedroom with wood burning fireplace, in-suite bathroom and dressing room overlooking the East Garden.

            ",Apartment,"desc::Introducing a Mid-Century Modern cooperative residence at River Park in SW Washington, DC. Built in the early 1960's by renowned mid-century modern architect, Charles M. Goodman, and the Reynolds Metals Company, River Park's cooperative apartments along with barrel roof town homes were part of DC's major urban renewal project for the SW DC and the waterfront area.  With approximately 650 sf of living space situated on the top floor of the north tower, this 1 bed 1 bath unit has an updated galley kitchen with cherry-stained shaker styled cabinetry, stainless steel electric range, built-in microwave, refrigerator with bottom freezer, granite counters and an undermount deep bowl sink and stylized faucet.  The engineered wood floors lead to a light filled combined dining and living area with westerly views of SW DC.  The former balcony was reclaimed as part of the living area with floor to ceiling sliding glass patio doors remaining to expose the mid-century styled architectural grid that shapes your scenic views of points west.  An ample sized bedroom has a wall of windows that provide abundant natural light and spectacular sunsets. A hallway and living room provide access to the bedroom through separate doors.  The updated hall bathroom has a tub/shower configuration, vanity with storage, modern commode, and tile wainscot in a traditional bathroom layout.  The coop fee includes all utilities, insurance, and common area maintenance.  The Seller will negotiate current outstanding and planned 2022 special assessment fees allocated for unit N823 for added peace of mind.  The common area hallways have a neutral palette, bright lighting, and high-grade carpeting for noise reduction. A fitness center, outdoor pool, party/recreation room and meeting rooms are some of the amenities at River Park.  Conveniently located near grocery, pharmacy, local theater, DC Wharf, restaurants, stadium venues, government agencies and Metro rail and bus boasting 97 bikers and 80 walk scores.  Parking is available for a monthly fee inside the gated community.||","Property Type::

            ",Apartment,"desc::Set in DC’s dynamic Ballpark District, there’s one collection of luxury residences that were built to stand out. Welcome to The Kennedy on L, an urban oasis where residents can live life on their terms at the center of it all. Outside, the building’s striking architectural exterior sets the tone for what you’ll find within: a boutique community that seamlessly combines showstopping design with tailor-made touches. Distinguished by towering windows, sweeping views, and elegant features, each 1 and 2 bed residence is timeless yet cutting-edge, memorable yet welcoming at the same time. Envisioned with cohesion, all condos include notable, high-end features — from the soaring ceilings that add a dash of drama to the wide plank wood flooring and the recessed lighting throughout. Other noteworthy characteristics include the kitchens’ stainless Bosch® appliance packages and custom flush panel cabinetry, as well as the frameless mirrors and Kohler® levity glass shower doors found in the bathrooms (to name just a few). In-unit laundry, space to spread out, and the option to select a unit with its own outdoor terrace further elevate the collective allure of this contemporary community on the rise. The Kennedy on L experience, however, doesn’t end when you walk out your front door. In fact, beyond the walls of your home, a world replete with sought-after amenities calls. From secure parking options to controlled lobby access, concierge services, a private resident club room, two expansive rooftop terraces, and an onsite pet spa to pamper your four-legged friend, Kennedy on L is the key to a streamlined, seamless routine that’s designed for you. And then there’s the location. Home to an eclectic array of restaurants, shops, and attractions, The Ballpark District has earned its reputation as a destination in demand for locals and visitors alike. Just steps from the picturesque Capitol Riverfront, this illustrious enclave brims with scenery, spirit, and an enduring nautical allure. Of course, sharing your home base with Nats Park has its perks, too. Spend a day rooting for the home team and transition seamlessly into a night on the town, sampling the coolest dining (and drinking) scene around. Go-to neighborhood haunts range from favorites like Bluejacket for craft beer to Salt Line for locally-sourced seafood, and District Winery for curated wine pairings served with waterfront views.

Household size must be 3 people or more and total maximum household income can not exceed  $139,300.00. The 1648 U Street, SE is a contributing building in DC?s Historic Anacostia District. The single-family dwelling was built in 1908 by J.E. Webster and architect A.L. Fuss for $4500. The property's most notable resident was John Edge, a Weather Bureau employee, veteran of the Spanish-American War, the Boxer Rebellion in China and the Philippine Insurrection. He received the Purple Heart for his efforts in the Philippines in 1899. Through the 1970s, veterans were given special preference to rent the property. The rear half of the dwelling was demolished in 2016 and was reconstructed by The L'Enfant Trust. The house retains its original bracketed cornice and siding. This WORKFORCE HOUSING @ 120%  MFI is drop-dead  gorgeous and a true turn key.||","Property Type::

For Church services, this is a turn-key opportunity, complete with fenced, off-street parking, inside Washington, D.C., in THIS market!  Does this property need some work?  Of course, it could use a facelift -- but who wouldn't need a little TLC after approximately 121 years of existence (the Tax Record shows Year Built is 1900)?  Is it worth your while to visit this property and see if it suits your needs?  Of course, it is!  Can you use this building for something other than a Church?  I can only tell you that I really believe that you can, but please ask the Washington, DC Zoning people.  They know more than I know and they can back up what they tell you with something in writing!  Can you convert this property to  become either single-family, multi-family or mixed use?  I'm sure that the DC Zoning office will be able to answer this and all of your questions regarding current and future use.

            ",House,"desc::Welcome to a Foxhall estate sited on a hill with nearly an acre of land surrounded by mature trees and offering dramatic Cathedral views.  This Williamsburg-inspired brick colonial and property have recently undergone a total transformation and expansion thoughtfully completed to delight the next fortunate owner.  With an exceptional layout for large scale entertaining plus comfortable family living, thereâs space for everyone.  A real strength of the home, though, is its ability to encourage indoor/outdoor living with amenities like a screened-in, covered, outdoor family room with fireplace and ventilated grilling station/kitchen, walls of windows, multiple French doors leading to the garden or stone terrace and a 40â x 20â heated swimming pool.  A large sport court with artificial turf and an adjacent treehouse create a setting for endless play.  Farther into the garden is an outdoor fireplace and small gathering area.  Some of the features on the main level include a gourmet kitchen with massive black walnut center island and breakfast bar that opens to a family room with wet bar, a grand dining room with fireplace and cathedral ceilings, a double-sized living room with large stone fireplace, front and back staircases, an elevator that services all levels, and a coat room.  The lower level is mostly above grade and is separated into 3 distinct areas:  1) A sophisticated wood-paneled family room/bar area with fireplace, billiards space, climate-controlled wine cellar with tasting table, safe room.  2) A large informal recreation room with cork floor, glass-walled exercise room, and exceptional storage.  3) An au-pair suite with full bath  The upper level has five bedrooms and four baths including a spacious ownerâs suite with large windows that offer scenic views, abundant closet space, and built-in storage.   A circular motor court at the front of the house leads to an oversized garage.  For automotive enthusiasts, the heated garage is a dream space capable of holding up to six cars (using lifts) in three bays.    For more than a century, Washingtonians have found Foxhall Road appealing for its large lots, elegant homes, and proximity to downtown offices and restaurants.  Today only a handful of the large properties remain undivided and in private ownership which makes 2601 Foxhall Road an exciting opportunity.||","Property Type::
