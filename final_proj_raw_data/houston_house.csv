            ",Rural,"desc::Shiner Ranch-52 acres Located 2.5 miles south of Shiner Texas, off HWY 95, you'll find the 52 +/- acre Shiner Ranch. Known as the “Cleanest Little City in Texas”, the Shiner Ranch holds true to this expression and is in an ideal location for a vineyard/ winery or venue. Shaped in a rectangle, this property offers great possibilities for an end user or investor eyeing an investment. The Shiner Ranch has scattered oaks, an abundance of grass for grazing with a gentle hilltop with mile-long views. The homesite is tucked back in oak trees with a pond sitting about 380 feet away allowing for easy access and the possibility to be transformed into a clubhouse.   Two water wells and electric are both available on the ranch. Land doesn't come available often in Shiner Texas, and this is your chance to own a prime piece of Texas! Call Texas Landmen today for your private showing to see how the Shiner Ranch fits your needs whether you're an end user or investor!||","Property Type::
