Please enquire about the five potential buildout options for this property. Four hundred acres of expansive conservation acreage surrounds a quiet street near the end of Low Beach Road. There one finds a rare opportunity on Cannonbury Lane: nature ensconced home sites promising coveted summer simplicity by way of a remote location, deeded beach access, and ready-to-build half acre lots. Walking distance to miles of spacious coastal views, and just steps away from afternoon dog walks with the kids, Cannonbury Lane's site design and amenities marry the best of the island's natural wonders in one location. Reach the deeded beach access at the end of your street by strolling the community-wide dunescaping and boardwalks that guide wheelbarrows to waves. Follow gentle undulations of sand and sea oats to the backside of the enclave to enjoy sunset yoga at the community gym and a private entrance to the acres of surrounding conservation land.||","Property Type::

There is over 365 feet of road frontage right on route 20 which is a well travelled road with plenty of potential customers driving by daily. The weekends have increased traffic and it is a very well travelled route during the Brimfield Antique show three weeks a year. This is a wonderful opportunity with plenty of potential.
