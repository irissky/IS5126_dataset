The fresh air coming off the Puget Sound is refreshing, especially in the heat of the summer when those breezes will keep the temperature a little cooler. This might be one reason why so many people are moving from Seattle to Port Orchard. The other reason is that D.R. Horton has a brand new community in Port Orchard named Stetson Heights. Like our other communities, Stetson Heights features quality, well-designed homes filled with value. What are options at other builders may be standard at D.R. Hortons Stetson Heights community. Perhaps one of our homes at Stetson Heights has your name on it. If so, youll have the opportunity to select it from 7 of our most popular and creative floorplans. Some even feature 3-car garages, a feature increasingly difficult to find in new homes.

Horton can meet your needs at Stetson Heights.Living at Stetson Heights and Port Orchard means you are also close to shopping, services, and recreational opportunities.

            ",House,"desc::Cute, comfortable and cozy! This Cheney charmer has been well loved and updated over the years. The new super efficient HVAC and driveway are just 2 of the most obvious improvements. The newer Hickory cabinet and Corian countertop galley kitchen could be an inspiration for the Chef in the family. The 2 shed / shop buildings in the spacious back yard are much more than storage sheds, I can see many pleasant hours being passed here on any number of hobbies. The 4th egress bedroom in the basement was mostly used as a sewing room and has the special soft close built ins to serve just that purpose. The upstairs fire place had the natural gas log removed, it functions fine as a wood burner. The downstairs fireplace has the popular pellet stove conversion. The original hardwood floors are a timeless asset that never goes out of style. Modern touches include vinyl windows, a nearly new heat pump with natural gas backup and natural gas hot water heater all professionally installed. Optical Fiber Internet!!||","Property Type::

What a unique piece of property!This would make a stunning hunting packing destination with an abundance of big game and turkeys on the property. You will find elk, moose, bear and both white tail and mule deer to hunt. And it is “end of the road” quiet and secluded! Surrounding the ranch are four mountains: Black Hawk Mountain on the southwest, Island Mountain on the northwest, Silver Crown on the northeast, and Bodie Mountain on the southeast. From the higher elevations on the property one can see the snow-capped mountains of the Red Mountain ski resort in Canada! The Canadian border is only a few miles away to the north. The property was most recently farmed in meadow hay and then used for cattle grazing. Fences and natural terrain will handle about 50 +/- cow/calf pairs. Haying generally produces one generous cutting of about 2-3 tons per acre annually. According to the seller and recent cruise, there is approximately $660,000 worth of marketable timber on the property with the last selective harvest done about 20 years ago. This 1967-built home on the property is a raised rancher with three bedrooms, two bathrooms and an unfinished walk-out basement. Every room has a territorial view of some part of the ranch! The kitchen and living areas are all very generous in size. There is both a formal dining area and a breakfast area with a large farm kitchen. The fireplace in the living room is all-natural stone harvested and cut in the area. Unique to this home is the construction! The walls are solid with laminated 2/4’s with no stud spacing in them. Windows on the living level have been upgraded to vinyl, while the basement has original aluminum framed windows. There is a natural artesian spring that provides water for the house, livestock and gardens. This spring flows directly out of the mountain into a pipe and cistern, then on to the homes. There is enough fall from the mouth of the spring (about 300 feet) to gravity flow with plenty of pressure to the home several hundred feet away. The barns are mostly original and show signs of vintage horse-drawn heritage! They are simple, but functional. The ‘chicken house’ was built to raise emus, but hasn’t been used for several years. And if one chooses to make a hunting camp/resort on the property, there is a modern meat locker room that will hold 6-8 beef at any one time! here are trails that can take you up most areas of the property to the top of the mountains This property is a must see!Price Reduced from $2,199,000 to $2,149,000Distance to:Spokane, WA  98 milesSandpoint, ID  110 milesColville, WA  31 miles Kelowna, BC 167 miles||","Property Type::

The home has laminate and tile flooring; modern double-pane vinyl windows and vinyl lap siding; an energy efficient 'mini-split' Heat Pump for HVAC.  Updated 200amp electrical service.  The floor plan allows for a small, but functional dining room area between the living room and kitchen. The attic has a drop-stair system above the washer/dryer that provides ease of access to a BUNCH of 'planked' attic storage.  The back yard is fenced.  There is a reasonable-sized open patio that connects the home and the oversized single-car garage.  The garage is entered through a 3/4 bathroom that 'houses' it's own water heater and has room for an extra refrigerator or freezer.  The garage is fully insulated and would make a FABULOUS winter hangout/workshop with the right heat source.  Currently, there are some wonderful tenants occupying the property.  They have a lease through the end of April, 2022.  The rent is $1,175/month and includes water and garbage.  The tenants pay their own electricity bill.  This could be perfect for an investor, as the tenants would LOVE to stay there longer than April.  The Seller has confirmed with the building & planning departments that there is ample room to add onto this home if someone needs more space in the future./Chad G Markel/CELL: 509-947-5590/Markel Properties//||","Property Type::

All interior fixtures and lighting have been thoughtfully selected by Gretl and her team of designers. We love the flexible space in this design! This can be either a 4 bedroom home or 3 bedroom home - use the 4th bedroom as a junior owner's suite or as a flex room for crafting, exercise, office, or party pad out to the backyard! The covered patio is expansive and a great place to relax and get out of the weather with the North facing location. Nestled on an estate sized lot,  lot 26, enjoy this large corner lot with room for a pool and a shop!  The kitchen is oversized and adjoins the dining and great room space, it includes an eat-at bar, loads of cabinets, full extension drawers, oversized walk-thru pantry, pendant lighting, quartz counters, full height splash and all the details that make Gretl's kitchens truly amazing. The owners' suite is located at the rear of the home with an All-City Closets package, dual sinks, free-standing tub + walk-in tile shower. The secondary bedrooms are oversized, both hosting walk-in closets. Don't miss your opportunity to snag this serene setting with proximity to major arterials, local wineries, The County Mercantile, Cottonwood Elementary, dining, retail, and MORE!/April R Connors/CELL: 509-539-6773/Windermere Group One/Tri-Cities/Elizabeth Bousquet/Cell: 509-392-1110||","Property Type::
